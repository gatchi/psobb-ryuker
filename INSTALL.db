"libmysql.lib" was recompiled for my system (i was getting an error suggesting
the provided library was compiled on a 32-bit system, and therefore incompatible).

Ideally, when compiling this server, it is either
  a) compiled specifically for the target machine
  b) two executables are made: one for 64-bit and one for 32-bit
  
Which makes me think this project should be divided into a folder for each arch.

Anyway, this project is not installable yet.  Please see the README for guidance on
installing the parent project, Tethealla, if you need a PSOBB server (that works).
