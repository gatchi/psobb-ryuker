PSO Ryuker Server
=================

Based off of Sodayboy's Tethealla server.  In development.

# Guidelines for this project

Tethealla is one of the (if not the) most widely used PSOBB servers out there, and the most widely
used open source PSOBB server.  However, Tethealla is not written in a very developer-friendly way.
Development is mostly done between two guys via Visual Studio collaboration tools.  It existing on GitHub
at all is an afterthought.

This project's goal is to produce a version of Tethealla that easy to work on via GitHub.  This will be done by:
* recreating the original function of the code but with modularity and good design practices in mind
* providing thorough documentation within the source so no guides are necessary for setup or editing
* facilitate collaboration on the project's GitHub
* make the project IDE independent
* prioritize Windows so its hobbyist friendly

As of right now, this code will not compile.  If you're looking for a PSOBB server,
check out [Tethealla server setup](https://www.pioneer2.net/community/threads/tethealla-server-setup-instructions.1/),
which contain both instructions and binaries.
